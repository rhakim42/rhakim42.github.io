Hi! I'm Rashida Hakim, a third-year Computer Science PhD student at Columbia University advised by Prof. Christos Papadimitriou and Prof. Mihalis Yannakakis. I am a member of the Columbia [Theory Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/). My interests are broadly in algorithmic game theory, with particular focuses on fairness, repeated games, game dynamics, and matchings. Before joining Columbia, I graduated in 2022 with a Bachelors in Computer Science from Caltech. In my free time, I like to read (recently memoir and autofiction), hike, and crochet/knit.
